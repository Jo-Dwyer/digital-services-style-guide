This page is a "collection index," because its URL matches the Jekyll collection specified in its `collection` front-matter property.

The title of a collection index page ("Example Project") appears at the top of each collection document and in the global navigation.

To change the title as it appears in the interior collection navigation, you can set the `nav_title` front-matter property (in this case, "Site Intro").
